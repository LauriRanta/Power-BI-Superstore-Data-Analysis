# Power-BI-Superstore-Data-Analysis
The objective of this project was to analyze a US-based Superstore dataset found from https://community.tableau.com/ , and transform data into an interactive dashboard with more information for example in sub-categories reagarding specific items.
The dashboard specifically aims to monitor the health of superstore sales in these years and provide an immediate “at-a-glance” view of the financial health, which we can see from the total sales and profit margin (KPI's).

From the charts we can see that the four-year-period reveals a consistent upward trend in revenue. To quantify this performance, I utilized linear regression to calculate the monthly growth velocity, which is an average incremental increase of $902.01 per month.

Below I have provided a youtube video link, where you can see how the interactive interface works.
