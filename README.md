# Power-BI-Superstore-Data-Analysis
The objective of this project was to inspect a superstore sample from US and transform it into easier way of understanding the data, of course compiling it into a chart-like format. 
The dashboard specifically aims to monitor the health of superstore sales in these years and provide an immediate “at-a-glance” view of the financial health, which we can see from the total sales and profit margin.

From the charts we can identify an upwards trend regarding sales during the almost four-year period. Using linear regression, I calculated the approximate growth rate per month, which is $902.01 / month.

Below I have provided a youtube video link, where you can see how the interactive interface works.
